		<![CDATA[
			<p>
            	IBM has just issued a callable (at its $100 par value) five-year, 8% coupon bond with annual coupon payments. The bond can be called at par in one year or anytime thereafter on a coupon payment date. It has a price of $103 per $100 face value, implying a yield to maturity of 7.26%.  Calculate the yield to call of the bond.
