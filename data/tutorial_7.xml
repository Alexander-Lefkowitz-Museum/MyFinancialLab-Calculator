			<p>
            	The Hobocus Company wants to purchase a machine currently leased from your company. You offer to sell it for the present value of the lease discounted at an annual interest rate of 20% compounded monthly. The machine has a residual value of $8,000 with 36 monthly payments of $1,500 remaining on the lease. If the payments are due at the beginning of each month, how much should you charge for the machine?
